This project is a [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk), [Kernelsu](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) module for Clash/mihomo, sing-box, v2ray, xray, hysteria. It supports REDIRECT (TCP only), TPROXY (TCP + UDP) transparent proxy, TUN (TCP + UDP), and hybrid mode REDIRECT (TCP) + TUN (UDP) proxy.

Based on upstream integration for one-stop service, ready to use. Suitable for:
- Lazy people
- Beginners

The project's theme and configuration focus on [Clash/mihomo.Meta](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/Clash.Meta).

This module needs to be used in a Magisk/Kernelsu environment. If you don't know how to configure the required environment, you might need applications like ClashForAndroid, v2rayNG, surfboard, SagerNet, AnXray.

## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. FirstTime Use</summary>

- After the module is installed for the first time, **please first** add your subscription URL in  
  `/data/adb/box_bll/clash/config.yaml`, or do it via the Web Desktop App  
  (**Note: SurfingTile must be invoked and Root permission is required**), then manually reboot your device once.
- After rebooting, toggle the module switch once, open the **Web App** on your desktop, and you can start using it.
- Due to network issues, not all **rules**/**subscriptions** may download automatically; please manually refresh them in the panel.
- If subscriptions fail to load, try switching the **Ua** in the configuration file.
- If the above fails, ensure your network environment is normal.

- Web App:
    - Can be used via Menu → Config Override → Fill in subscription
    - Used for portable browsing and managing backend routing data
    - Automatically updates core files on startup

<summary>2. Controlling Operation</summary>

- You can control start/stop via **WiFi SSID**.
- You can control service using the module toggle switch  
  `Changes take effect in real time, no reboot required`
- You can add the module's control tile to the system status bar  
  `If SurfingTile is already installed`

</details>

#

<details>
<summary>3. Routing Rules</summary>

- GitHub Actions builds automatically  
  All routing rules use online subscriptions to ensure they are always up-to-date

> Automatically updates every 24 hours

</details>

#

<details>
<summary>4. Future Updates</summary>

- If you are using all default configurations, updates will be seamless.
- Supports online updates from the client; reboot is not required, but still recommended.
- During updates, configuration files will be backed up to:
   - `config.yaml.bak`
- User configuration files will be backed up to:
   - `box.config.bak`
- Subscription URLs will be automatically extracted and backed up to:
   - `proxies/subscribe_urls_backup.txt`
   - The backup will be automatically restored into the new configuration, suitable for default configuration usage.

> Ps: Mainly follows upstream updates and pushes some configuration adjustments.

<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

### Proxy Specific Apps (Blacklist / Whitelist)

- To proxy all apps except certain ones, open `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config`,  
  set `proxy_mode` to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array.  
  The element format is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces.  
  These apps will **not** be proxied.  
  Example: `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")`

- To proxy only specific apps, open `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config`,  
  set `proxy_mode` to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array.  
  The element format is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces.  
  Only these apps will be proxied.  
  Example: `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")`

Android user group IDs:

| User Type       | ID  |
| --------------- | --- |
| Owner           | 0   |
| Phone Clone     | 10  |
| Multiple Apps   | 999 |

> You can usually find all user group IDs and app package names under `/data/user/`.

### Tun Mode
- Disabled by default
- When using blacklist/whitelist, exclude the corresponding package names

> Can be enabled or disabled manually via configuration if needed.

### Routing Rules
- Optimized for Mainland China
- Meets most daily usage requirements

> With increasingly robust routing rules, blacklist/whitelist is becoming less necessary.

### Panel Management
- Magisk font modules

> May affect proper display of panel fonts.

### LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot to allow other devices to connect
- Tun Gateway: `172.20.0.1`

> To access the backend console from other devices:  
> `http://<CurrentWiFi>/<TunGateway>:9090/ui`

### Host File
- No need to mount: just delete the file
- To remount: create a new one in the **etc folder**
- All changes take effect immediately
- During update/installation, you can use volume keys Up(**Mount**) / Down(**Unmount**) to choose

> Local IP redirection for domains, forced binding

<summary>6. SurfingTile App</summary>

### Quick Settings Tile Service

### 📱 Device Requirements
> Supports Android 8+, recommended to run on Android 10+

- Must run in **system space** and require **Root** permission
- For **KSU** users, you need to install the **"Meta Module"** to obtain mount permissions
- The tile works entirely based on the **Clash API**, please check if the API settings are correct
  - **Path:** → Web App → Menu → Tile Settings

### Features
- Supports app filtering, network filtering, and partial config override via UI
- Supports managing and clearing redundant useless data in the core connection pool

### Permission Declaration
- **GPS Location** → Used to obtain `Saved WiFi Network List`
- **App List** → Used to obtain `Installed App Package List`

> All network requests of this app are initiated via `HttpURLConnection`,  
> and are strictly used to communicate with the local Clash core service.

Detailed usage:

### API Address
- Default: `http://127.0.0.1:9090`
- Can be modified in the app's API settings

### Functions

### 1. Check Service Status
- Uses the `/version` endpoint to determine whether Clash is running  
- **Method:** `isApiAliveHttp`

### 2. Get and Switch Proxies
- Uses `GET` and `PUT` requests to `/proxies/total_mode`  
- Used to get the current selected proxy  
- Double-tap the tile to switch to the next proxy  
- **Method:** `cycleTotalModeProxy`

### 3. Manage Connections
- Uses `GET` and `DELETE` requests to `/connections`  
- Fetch current network connections  
- Clean up useless or stale connections  
- **Methods:**
  - `clearAllConnections`
  - `probeAndCleanStaleConnections`

### Two Different Network Usage Scenarios in This Project

### 1. Communicating with Local Proxy Service (Core Function)
- **Path:** `SurfingTileService.java`
- **Address:** `http://127.0.0.1:9090`  
  (or other address specified in settings)
- **Purpose:**  
  Core functionality of the app, using HTTP (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  to communicate with the local Clash backend service for:
  - Checking service status
  - Getting / switching proxies
  - Managing and cleaning connections

### 2. Fetching Quotes from the Internet (UI Function)
- **Path:** `AppFilterActivity.java`
- **Purpose:**  
  In the app filter UI (`AppFilterActivity`), the app fetches data from
  the project's GitHub repository and randomly displays a quote.  
  This is a **non-core UI feature**.

The necessity of the `INTERNET` permission is reflected in two aspects:

1. Interacting with the local proxy core (required)
2. Fetching remote text content for display

These are the **only network-related behaviors** in this project.

---

### 3. FAQ

- **App filter cannot display app list**:  
  You can first disable the mount of the SurfingTile sub-module, reboot the device,
  then re-enter permission management and grant App List permission / GPS permission (for WiFi SSID).

- **Tile status shows No Sys | No Root**:  
  Not running as a system app / Root permission not granted.
